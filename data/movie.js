  Plot:
  
  Act 1:
  The film opens in the sacred city of Varanasi, where Arjun grows up under the guidance of his wise grandmother, Mira. He learns the principles of dharma (righteousness) and the importance of upholding one's duty. The region is under the rule of the Gupta Empire, which has maintained a delicate balance between political power and spiritual harmony.

  Arjun's travels lead him to the remote Himalayan monastery of Nandavan, where he meets Surya, a master of yoga and meditation. Under Surya's guidance, Arjun's physical and spiritual prowess grows. He learns that true strength lies not just in physical might but also in harnessing the power of the mind and spirit.
  
  Back in the heartland, King Kalan's oppression intensifies. Villages are razed, sacred texts destroyed, and temples desecrated. The people's hope wanes as they long for a savior.
